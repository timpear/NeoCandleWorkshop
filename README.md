This is sample code for a workshop building a lantern in a Ball jar with an Adafruit NeoPixel and Gemma board.

Adafruit's Arduino IDE is needed to upload the code to a Gemma or Trinket (Arduino-compatible) board.

This will not run on a Mac unless you change System Preferences / Security & Privacy / General / "Allow applications downloaded from:" to Anywhere.

The Adafruit Arduino IDE includes the NeoPixel library, but if you are using a different board and the standard IDE, download the library from:

To learn all about NeoPixels, read Adafruit's NeoPixel Ãœberguide.
